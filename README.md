# SimpleMediaPlayer
A simple media player. Thats it. Plays videos or displays images.

This is a lightweight media program written in java 24. The purpose is mainly to help my understanding of java/javafx as well as making a, well, simple media player. I'm not necessarily trying to market this as anything better than standards such as VLC or MPC-HC, as this is more of a hobby project than anything else. I just wanted a very simple way to view media, without any fancy settings or telemetry tacked on.

Should run fine on both windows and major linux distros, feel free to report any issues.
